# Legend List

**Legend List** is a high-performance list component for **React Native**, written purely in Typescript with no native dependencies. It is a drop-in replacement for `FlatList` and `FlashList` with better performance, especially when handling dynamically sized items.

## ü§î Why Legend List?

*   **Performance:** Designed from the ground up and heavily optimized for performance, it is faster than FlatList and other list libraries in most scenarios.
*   **Dynamic Item Sizes:** Natively supports items with varying heights without performance hits.
*   **Drop-in Replacement:** API compatibility with `FlatList` and `FlashList` for easier migration.
*   **100% JS:** No native module linking required, ensuring easy integration and compatibility across platforms.
*   **Lightweight:** Our goal is to keep LegendList as small of a dependency as possible. For more advanced use cases, we plan on supporting optional plugins. This ensures that we keep the package size as small as possible.
*   **Bidirectional infinite lists:** Supports infinite scrolling in both directions with no flashes or scroll jumping
*   **Chat UIs without inverted:** Chat UIs can align their content to the bottom and maintain scroll at end, so that the list doesn't need to be inverted, which causes weird behavior (in animations, etc...)

## ‚ú® Additional Features

Beyond standard `FlatList` capabilities:

*   `recycleItems`: (boolean) Toggles item component recycling.
    *   `true`: Reuses item components for optimal performance. Be cautious if your item components contain local state, as it might be reused unexpectedly.
    *   `false` (default): Creates new item components every time. Less performant but safer if items have complex internal state.
*   `maintainScrollAtEnd`: (boolean) If `true` and the user is scrolled near the bottom (within `maintainScrollAtEndThreshold * screen height`), the list automatically scrolls to the end when items are added or heights change. Useful for chat interfaces.
*   `alignItemsAtEnd`: (boolean) Useful for chat UIs, content smaller than the View will be aligned to the bottom of the list.

// Define the type for your data items
interface UserData {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    photoUri: string;
}

const LegendListExample = () => {
    // Optional: Ref for accessing list methods (e.g., scrollTo)
    const listRef = useRef<LegendListRef | null>(null)

    const data = []

    const renderItem = ({ item }: LegendListRenderItemProps<UserData>) => {
        return (
            <View>
                <Image source={{ uri: item.photoUri }} />

        )
    }

    return (
        <LegendList
            // Required Props
            data={data}
            renderItem={renderItem}

            // Recommended props (Improves performance)
            keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
            recycleItems={true}

            // Recommended if data can change
            maintainVisibleContentPosition

            ref={listRef}
        />
    )
}

export default LegendListExample

```

## How to Build

1. `bun i`
2. `bun run build` will build the package to the `dist` folder.

## Running the Example

1. `cd example`
2. `bun i`
3. `bun run ios`

## PRs gladly accepted!

There's not a ton of code so hopefully it's easy to contribute. If you want to add a missing feature or fix a bug please post an issue to see if development is already in progress so we can make sure to not duplicate work üòÄ.

## Upcoming Roadmap

- [] Column spans
- [] overrideItemLayout
- [] Sticky headers
- [] Masonry layout
- [] getItemType
