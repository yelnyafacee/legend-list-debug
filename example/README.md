# Welcome to LegendList test application ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).
This app is main development playground for testing LegendList features

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Testing on old arhitecture

LegendList is by default ran on the react native new architecture. It's important to check compatibility with old architecture.

To build version for old architecture:
1. delete your ios and anrdoid folders
2. build new versions 
```
OLD_ARCH=TRUE bun android
OLD_ARCH=TRUE bun ios
```
Those applications will have separate app name list-test-oldarch and different app id, so both old and new architectures can be tested on same device.
